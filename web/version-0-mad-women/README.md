# MAD WOMEN PROFILE CARDS

This project allows you to create your personal profile cards which include your contact data(phone number and email address) and links to your Linkedin and GitHub accounts. To do that you'll need to fill in all the required inputs. If you miss some, don't worry, you'll receive a notification which one you have missed.

Each card you can create choosing your own design(colors). And once the card is created you'll have an option to share it on Twitter, inviting people to contact you or to see your Linkedin and Github profiles.

We created this project using HTML for the content, SASS - for the styles and JavaScript for functions. Mainly this project was done to practice JavaScript's functions, events, loops, arrays, LocalStorage and how to make requests to the server.
